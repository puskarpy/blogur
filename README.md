> So, Bloggur is my humble attempt at a blogging platform—no fancy frontend libraries, no React acrobatics. Just good old Node.js, Express, and EJS, like it’s 2015 again. Users can sign up, log in, log out, write blogs, and drop comments. That’s it (for now). Styling? Yeah, it's Bootstrap—don’t expect Tailwind-level drip. It works, it's functional, and it’s teaching me the backend fundamentals properly. UD operations (Update and  Delete) are still under construction, but hey, one thing at a time.
